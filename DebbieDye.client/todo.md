Steps


First, all documents and MLS information for the property are verified.
A digital folder is created in Google Drive to easily share files.
The transaction is filed for the broker.
All requisite documents are uploaded to the transaction management system.

Introductions are made; emails go out to lenders, listing agents, title companies, and buyers with copies of all the important documents.
Earnest money and receipts are requested from the relevant parties. This is uploaded and sent to all parties. The funder receives instructions for deposits.
Information about utilites and preliminary buying agreements are sent to the buyer.

The agent is reminded the day before the due date of the RE-10 Inspection Report, and its significance to the transaction is considered and communicated.
Repairs and credits are noted and the RE10 is sent to lender and title if the sale price changes.
Status of repairs is checked, and compliance is again assessed of the parties involved.

The settlement statement is reviewed for accuracy by two sets of eyes, and is signed and uploaded to the transaction management system.
Commission checks are uploaded, the property folder in Drive is considered closed and is archived for 1 year.
In OTC, the transaction status is changed to closed.
